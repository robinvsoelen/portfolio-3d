    <h1>Dimenco and Leia</h1>
    
    <p>In February 2023, I started an exciting chapter with Dimenco, a pioneer in 3D display technology that lets you see 3D without glasses. Their tech uses eye-tracking and a special layer on the screens that splits pixels into views for your left and right eyes.</p>

    <p>At Dimenco, I was part of the applications team, where I worked on a variety of projects. I helped develop a video player and a model viewer that are all about bringing 3D to life. I was also tasked with the implementation of a hub for keeping track of these 3D apps and their updates. I designed and implemented the backend for it. Plus, I had the chance to play around with Unity to make demos that really showed off what our tech could do.</p>

    <p>Things got interesting in the summer of 2023 when Dimenco was acquired by Leia. Post-acquisition, my main gig was to enhance the 3D video player. I added a feature that could turn plain old 2D videos into 3D in real-time, thanks to Leia's 3D conversion models. Besides this, I tackled improving the video player's performance, making it faster and smoother for a better user experience.</p>
