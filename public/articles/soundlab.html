    <h1 class="work-title">Internship SoundLab</h1>
    <i>Completed in: December 2019 </i>

    <p>I did an internship at the SoundLab in Enschede during my master <a href="INTERNAL_LINK/university.html">interaction technology</a>. This is a new workshop space in Enschede that is being designed for children to experiment and play with sound. Together with music teacher students I designed and created three prototypes which are explained below. </p>


    <h2>Project 1: Singing game</h2>
    <p class="work-text">
        This game can be best described as a combination between singstar and flappy bird. The concept of the game is to use the pitch of your voice to control the height of a flying zeppelin. The goal is to avoid obstacles and collect items. Throughout the game the scenery changes and audio effects that correspond to that scenery are added to the voice (for example: delay in the mountains). I created a functional prototype in Max MSP.
    </p>

    <p>I also created a dashboard for teachers so that they easily could adapt the difficulty and vocal range to each student.</p>

    <p>Afterwards, a group of computer science students adapted this design into a <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://bachelorshowcase-eemcs.apps.utwente.nl/view/6mG6j1FU">web based application</a></p>

    <h2>Project 2: Interactive floor</h2>
    <p class="work-text">The second project I created during this internship made use of an interactive floor that is displayed in the DesignLab at the University of Twente. This system uses kinect sensors to measure the position of users within a  room and uses two beamers to project these locations onto the floor.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using Unity and Fmod I created an application that uses this floor to let people get familiar with musical styles. In this application four vinyls are projected onto the floor. Each vinyl corresponds to a certain genre of music. When a user steps onto a vinyl an audio loop of that genre starts playing. Each user has the possiblity to "become" the rythm, bass, melody and harmony section, which determines the type of audio loop that starts playing.   
    </p>

    <p>
        The application was evaluated with a group of children who were very enthousiastic about the system.
    </p>

    <h2>Project three: Music glove</h2>
    <p class="work-text">During the third project of this internship I experimented with using IMU sensors to control musical parameters through movement. I added a light sensor to the palm of the hand to measure whether it was open or not. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I immediately became a fan of how natural this interaction with the glove felt and the amount of possiblities it offered. This project lay the foundation of the embodied music controller which I developed for my master thesis.
