    <i>Completed in: January 2017. Team members: Oliver Horst and Sjoerd Baarslag</i>
    <p>This prototype was build as part of a business module at the University of Twente. It is still one of my favorite projects I worked on.</p>

    <p class="work-text">
        The emerging of music streaming services like Spotify, Apple music and Youtube music has created the ability
        to have instant access to almost every song imaginable. Due to this, the feeling of actually owning music
        has been fading away. Every album is at your fingertips while none of them can actually be touched.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project creates change by making music tangible again. The blandaband is a music player on which the
        user can put music cards which link to playlist/album/song on a streaming service. What music is on the
        cards and what they look like is up to the user, since these can be created and ordered online.

    <p>To test this concept, a fully working prototype has been made. The prototype is working through a Raspberry
        pi which is running “pi musicbox” to be able to stream from Spotify. The cards are being recognised using an
        RFID reader. The cards have an implemented RFID chip.
