    <h1>This website!</h1>
    <p>I started working on this website after hearing I was going to be part of the layoffs at Leia. I had a lot of fun implementing a lot of features that most likely 90% viewers will never notice.</p>
    
    <p> It uses the following technologies: </p>
        <li><b>React</b></li>
        <li><b>ThreeJS Fiber:</b> Framework for WebGL that integrates with React</li>
        <li><b>Firebase:</b> both for deployment and backend for the drawings</li>

    <p>I used Blender to create models and adjust models downloaded from the web.</p>

    <p>The code can be found <a href="">here</a></p>
