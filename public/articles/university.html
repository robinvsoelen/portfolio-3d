    <p>I got my education at the University of Twente. Here a little bit about the bachelor Creative Technology and the Master Interaction Technology</p>
    <h2>Creative Technology</h2>
    <p>My journey through the Creative Technology program was an eclectic blend of electrical engineering, design, programming, business, and research. We often integrated these disciplines through projects that required us to conceive, create, and evaluate prototypes. One of my favorite projects was the <a href="INTERNAL_LINK/blandaband.html">Blandaband</a></p>

    <h2>Interaction Technology</h2>
    <p>The master's program in Interaction Technology allowed me to delve deeper into more focused and specific areas of study. The coursework included advanced topics like machine learning, statistics and image processing, but also included extemely fun ones like storytelling through sound. I completed an <a href="INTERNAL_LINK/soundlab.html">internship at the SoundLab </a>, where I designed various prototypes for innovative musical instruments. The highlight of my master's journey was my <a href="INTERNAL_LINK/thesis.html">thesis project</a>, where I developed an embodied music controller.</p>
